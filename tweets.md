What if digital tools didnâ€™t summarize a whole corpusâ€”but helped historians find meaning in just a few documents? ðŸ“œ GaLiLeO (Galileoâ€™s Library and Letters Online) is a prototype digital lab that builds interpretive paths through Galileoâ€™s letters, books & notes.

Unlike most text mining tools, GaLiLeO doesnâ€™t aim for sweeping models. Instead, it helps researchers identify meaningful links across Galileoâ€™s libraryâ€”prioritizing interpretive, humanistic inquiry over scale. Itâ€™s built for discovery, not datafication.

GaLiLeO is unfinished & its corpus incomplete. But thatâ€™s the point. It shows how partial, purpose-built tools can still yield insightâ€”especially when they trace relationships that archives and metadata might miss. A third space between archive and algorithm.
